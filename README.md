##  Required: Git LFS

IMPORTANT: This repository uses [Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage large files, such as datasets.  
**Before cloning the repository, you must install Git LFS** — otherwise, you’ll receive small pointer files instead of the actual data, and the project may not function correctly.

### Installation Instructions by Platform - use at your own risk!

#### ▸ macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)
If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

#### ▸ Windows
1. Download and run the official Git LFS installer: https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. Then open Git Bash or PowerShell and run:

```bash
git lfs install
```

#### ▸ Linux 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

_For other Linux distributions, see the Git LFS installation page: https://git-lfs.github.com/_

---

###  After Installation

Once Git LFS is installed, you can safely clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
```

Git LFS will automatically fetch the large files during the clone.
