# Working Project Title
Bridging the Digital Divide for the Next Billion Users: Can we predicting changes in overall wellbeing and national economic health based on digital inclusion?

##  Required: Git LFS

IMPORTANT: This repository uses [Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage large files, such as datasets.  
**Before cloning the repository, you must install Git LFS** — otherwise, you’ll receive small pointer files instead of the actual data, and the project may not function correctly.

### Installation Instructions by Platform - use at your own risk!

#### ▸ macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)
If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

#### ▸ Windows
1. Download and run the official Git LFS installer: https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. Then open Git Bash or PowerShell and run:

```bash
git lfs install
```

#### ▸ Linux 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

_For other Linux distributions, see the Git LFS installation page: https://git-lfs.github.com/_

###  After Installation

Once Git LFS is installed, you can safely clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
```

Git LFS will automatically fetch the large files during the clone.


## Background
The expansion of internet connectivity and digital technologies in the past decade globally has given way to multiple opportunities to address long-standing global disparities in livelihood, economic participation, and education. While a significant portion of the world's population has been online for several decades, the "next billion users,” often residing in low-income and middle-income countries, are in the developmental stages of global digital inclusion. This demographic represents more than just a new market, and the fostering of socio-economic development and global engagement for these members is now at the forefront of humanitarian efforts that can be enacted upon more readily than before. 

Historically, lack of access to information and resources has perpetuated cycles of poverty and limited educational attainment in many regions of the Global South. The advent of widespread, affordable internet promises to dismantle these barriers. Digital literacy and access to online learning platforms can provide individuals with the skills necessary to participate in the modern economy, improve health outcomes through access to information, and foster greater civic engagement. 

The "digital divide" extends beyond mere connectivity and encompasses disparities in device ownership, digital literacy, and the availability of relevant and accessible content due to language bias. These challenges are often compounded for populations with disabilities, who face additional hurdles such as inaccessible physical environments, lack of assistive devices and technologies, and discriminatory societal attitudes. Globally, over a billion people experience some form of disability, and they disproportionately face adverse socioeconomic outcomes due to these barriers.

Recognizing these challenges, initiatives like Google's "Next Billion Users" emphasize the importance of user research in low-income and middle-income countries to develop inclusive tools and products that address specific needs, such as limited storage on older devices, high data costs, and a preference for mobile-first experiences. 

This project aims to leverage data science methodologies to understand the nuanced dynamics of technology adoption and its impact on livelihood and education within these emerging online populations, with a specific focus on ensuring equitable access and benefits for underprivileged individuals of minority status and also those with disabilities. By analyzing patterns of internet usage, educational attainment, and economic indicators, we seek to identify key drivers of positive change and pinpoint areas where targeted interventions can maximize the transformative potential of digital inclusion.


## Research question
To what extent has the differential growth in mobile broadband subscriptions influenced the improvements in educational attainment and economic participation among global minority populations within the "next billion users" in low-income and middle-income countries over the past decade, and how does this impact compare to digital inclusion patterns and socio-economic development in more developed nations?

## Hypothesis & Predictions

Hypothesis 

How does the adoption of mobile broadband subscriptions, as opposed to static home broadband, influence the overall socio-economic development of nations through the education and livelihood improvements of global minorities within the "next billion users" in low-income and middle-income countries compared to more developed nations?

Prediction

We predict that widespread adoption of mobile broadband will be the primary driver of socio-economic development for global minorities within the "next billion users" in low-income and middle-income countries. Mobile-first digital inclusion is expected to lead to a synergistic effect in both educational outcomes and economic participation for minority populations within these regions, resulting in a measurable reduction in poverty and improved standard of living nationally over the past decade particularly in regions where mobile connectivity is the most viable and affordable option.
